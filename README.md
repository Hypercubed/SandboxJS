SandboxJS
=========
### JavaScript "Sandboxes" for the web browser.

This script offers a very simple interface for JavaScript ["Sandboxes"][WikipediaSandbox].
Underneath, it uses the [magic power of `iframe`s][DeanEdwards] to create
new execution scopes for JavaScript to be evaluated inside of.

This could potentially be used as the backbone for browser-side:

 * Isolated scope module loading (CommonJS could implemented on top of this).
 * Client-side HTML templates, with access to certain defined variables.
 * Defining custom JavaScript environments (APIs), then loading external
   _script_ files that interact with the custom API (abstracting the browser/DOM away).



API
---

    new Sandbox([bare:Boolean]) -> sandbox

Creates and returns new `Sandbox` instance. The `bare` parameter
defaults to _true_, and determines whether or not the sandbox environment
should attempt to have all it's extraneous browser/DOM objects removed from
the scope. Setting this to _false_ will keep functions like `alert`, and
`XMLHttpRequest` available for use inside the sandbox.

    sandbox.global -> Global

The `global` scope of the sandbox instance. This is a convenient way
to share instances of `Object`s across scopes, or prepare the sandbox
environment with properties that scripts can use (like a "require()" function).

    sandbox.eval(jsStr:String) -> ?

Calls `eval` on the given `String` inside the sandbox. Variables declared
inside the sandbox won't be accessible globally, and global variables won't
be visible inside the sandbox. The result of the `eval` is returned.

    sandbox.load(filename:String [, callback:function(err) {}])

Loads the JavaScript file `filename` and executes it into the sandbox. `callback`
is an optional function that gets invoked when the file has finished loading and
being evaluated, or an error occurs (like the file was not found).

    sandbox.loadSync(filename:String)

Synchronously loads the JavaScript file `filename` and executes it into the
sandbox. If there is an error while loading (like the file was not found),
then this function will throw. This function is highly discouraged, since synchronous network
activity blocks the browser, making it appear to _freeze_! Also, underneath
this function uses `XMLHttpRequest`s, which are restricted by the [Same Origin Policy][SameOriginPolicy].
In other words, this function will ONLY work with files from the SAME DOMAIN.



What Isn't SandboxJS?
---------------------

 - `Sandboxes` are _NOT_ seperate threads. All `Sandbox` instances share the same
   event-loop that the current page uses. As such, never block indefinitely;
   something like this _WILL_ freeze your browser:

    (new Sandbox()).eval('while(1) {}');


 - `Sandboxes` are _NOT_ prisons. Depending on the browser, there may be no way to
   eliminate access to the global scope. So follow the words of Isaac Schlueter:
   _Prisons are designed to keep dangerous criminals. Sandboxes are for children to
   not get lost or hurt while playing. There are several ways to  break out of the
   sandbox... DON'T!_


Script Caching
--------------

The `<iframe>`s used internally seem to be stricter than the host page in
regards to script caching. It is sometimes necessary to add appropriate `no-cache`
headers to the HTTP response from your web server to mitigate this problem.

Testing from a `file://` URI doesn't seems to share the same problem (scripts
are always reloaded from disk as expected).
